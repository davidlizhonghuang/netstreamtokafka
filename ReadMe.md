# .Net data streamer to pull data from Kafka

To pull data from Kafka in a .NET application, you can use the `Confluent.Kafka` library, which is a popular library for working with Kafka in .NET. Below is an example of how you can create a data streamer to consume messages from a Kafka topic.

### Step 1: Install the Confluent.Kafka NuGet Package
First, you need to install the `Confluent.Kafka` NuGet package. You can do this using the NuGet Package Manager or by running the following command in the Package Manager Console:
 
 dotnet add package Confluent.Kafka

### Step 2: Create the Kafka Consumer             

### Step 3: Run the Consumer
Run the application, and it will start consuming messages from the Kafka topic. The consumer will continue to run until you press Ctrl+C, at which point it will gracefully shut down.  

### Step 4: Handle Deserialization
If your Kafka messages are not in string format, you will need to handle deserialization. The `Confluent.Kafka` library allows you to specify custom deserializers for both the key and value of the Kafka message.
